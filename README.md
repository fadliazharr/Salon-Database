The script interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store customer data, services offered, and scheduled appointments.

## What It Shows

This project demonstrates:
- Basic database design with foreign key relationships
- Reading and writing to a PostgreSQL database from a Bash script
- User input validation and condition handling in Bash
- Simple CRUD operations using SQL from the command line

## How It Was Made

The project was created using:
- PostgreSQL to design and manage the relational database
- Bash scripting to handle user interaction and run SQL queries via `psql`

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL
- Bash
- Git
